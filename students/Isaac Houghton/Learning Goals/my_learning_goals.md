## How do you intend to achieve your goals?
Work hard at attaing them. This includes attending my lectures, listening to my course leaders, and taking the initiative to learn further outside of my course parameters in the process of completing the exercises and assignments set.

## How do you learn best? What hinders your learning?
I am aware that i have a tendency to learn better/faster through visual and kinesthetic stimulation. My learning progress can be hindered by lack of concentration at times if i cant visually interpret what i try to learn.

## Are your goals SMART?
I believe my goals are smart as i have a specific route and layout of what i want to learn. I definely measure what it is i want to learn and what the goals will give me as a web media student. They are attainable as they are not unachieveable in the time i need to learn the.
If i routinely work towards my goals, they are effectively **SMART**.
